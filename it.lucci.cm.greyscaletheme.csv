Just followed instructions. Worked perfectly on my unrooted Note 20+ and A52. Now I can switch between colour & gray in one click, instead of searching through developer options menu every time. Auto mode switching by selected apps is a great feature, but is't reliable with video apps. VLC, Tubi, Pluto revert back to grayscale when touched or rotated",5

That's why I installed this app. Hope you know how to fix this problem, so that I can fully appreciate the app.",4

If you are having trouble finding your device after inputting the ""adb devices"" command, try turning on ""Stay Awake"" on your device and then turning USB Debugging on and trying again.

com.vegardit.grayswitch,Pablo Halpern,"The built-in greyscale mode requires going through 4-5 levels of menus turn on or off. I turned greyscale mode on this morning the ""hard way"" (through developer settings) and fell in love with it! It's so much less distracting and easier on the eyes! The problem was that if I wanted to turn it off to look at some photos or watch YouTube, I had to go through all those menus to turn greyscale off, then repeat the process afterwards to turn it back on. That's where this App comes in: Once you go through the admittedly annoying setup (though the youtube video helps and is simple enough to follow on both PC and Mac), I can toggle grey mode easily from the notification menu. Better yet, I can exclude specific apps (like photos) so that they *automatically* run in full color. Thank you for this free app! P.S. Don't forget to turn off USB debugging when you're done!",5

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Sherin Thomas,hope there would be a call screen,3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Ahil Khan,loved theme in emui8 but its slightly incompatible with emui9 some icon are not as good as was in previous version. if you cloud do something.,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Dhamodharan V,I'm using it for few months after updating to Oreo system icons and navigation icons not changing as shown. it become useless after updating to Oreo,2
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,"Great theme I specially like the oreo one. However, the battery icon is overlapping with the emui8 icon. I think the emui8 icon should be removed? Thanks. Edit: works , thanks.",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Sean Kellar,"Made my MediaPad T3 10 look like stock Nougat. Great job, I honestly couldn't ask for more.",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,ËµµÊòÄ,Fantastic. Thanks a lot to anthor.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Sandro Boghossian,"I used to love this theme on EMUI 5 but now that I moved to EMUI 8, everything barely works anymore. Colors on the teal theme change to light blue at random and the icons on top are close to being in the middle of the status bar, far from the clock. Work on it please",3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Md. Rozaer Hossen,Good,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,David Murray,"Needs 8.1 support! I know it won't be long till you fix it, but my p20 pro

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Geetesh Kumbhare,This is first theme that I like a lot. Specially pixel theme. Thank you,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,M M,Excellent theme. Well done,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,fjvdxhvh bydcteui,the pixel theme is awesome,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Alex Middleton,"Nice but some flaws. It doesn't appear to change the text or icons on the 
notification bar, apart from the battery icon, which shows the outline as a 
horizontal but the indicator showing how much charge is left is vertical, 
so it looks a bit odd. Using on Huawei Mate 10 Pro.",3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,ravishka sasanka,I can't believe . üòçüòçüòç Love you soo much. Best theme for emui üî•üî•üî•,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Jovan Zeng,"Great theme, well done! One of a few themes that don't ruin the clock app. Thank You!",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Jaden Corner,This is what I have been looking for a stock android experience and it is easy to install after a restart the battery orientation was fine. Definitely recommend,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Omar Ismail,In future updates can you make the nav bar looks like the pixel?,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Ste Putra,It would be great if the notification bar looks transparent. Hopefully the developers listen to my opinion.,3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Andrew Navarette,Looks great I love this theme. Much cleaner than the stock Huawei theme.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Alvin John Ceniza,"Hi Hamzio7. Overall, great job! Been using this for quite a while and I guess this is the most consistent and coherent as to design. On future updates, can I request for an Android P style theme bundled in here? Would that be possible?",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Terrence Z,Works on my EMUI 8.0 nova 2s well. Very nice app for changing the theme.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Bojan Stanojevic,"Hey, on Android 8 on honor 9 it seems like the battery in status bar is way too separated from the clock, can you check it out? Best emui theme that I found. :-)",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Ed Pacson,Great theme but it seems that the battery percentage text is too large especially if you set it to be displayed inside the vertical battery icon. Also I noticed that only the bluetooth word (not the icon) is highlighted even if it's turned on?,3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Mike Morley,"Seems ok, but device (mate Pro 10) said it was old theme and may have trouble",4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Kester Martinez,"not working on my mate 10 pro, after installing checked my themes manager, cant see aosp theme. am i missing something?",3
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Adam Baker,"This theme is great, a couple months ago I had to mix the themes together for it to be an acceptable experience, but with all of the improvements you have made it is now almost perfect. The white navbars buttons make me so happy, the new look for the settings app is such a huge improvement over before. Well done!",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,mick jk,"Perfect, but my home button is slightly smaller than the recent and back button. Maybe it's just my taste or a scaling problem?",4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,erin wallden,Nextbit Robin is my current fav. Wondering if we can get a version with a semi-transparent status bar background instead of solid white?,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,Almost perfect. This is the theme I keep for my mobiles. But there are some minute bugs and inconsistencies which should be weeded out. If you want I can give u a detailed video demo of the area. Get in touch with me if interested.,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Mark Parre√±as,One of the best raw android themes in the store right now.  Any chance you'd have AMOLED or Black versions of these themes? I know there's one out there but still on v1.9.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Bojan Malinoviƒá,Is there a way to reduce gap between notification icons. On mate 10 pro gap between clock and battery and battery and wifi is bigger than between other icons. Also back button seems bigger than other buttons.,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Naseem Ahmad,Excellent,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Anton Monev,Scam!,1
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,Awesome theme.,5

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Edwin Davis,Please change the blue font colour in gallery for the down menu while viewing pictures...cant see it perfectly,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Jake Long,Everything is fine but The previous inbuilt battery Icon isn't Changing . Plz fix this ??????,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,It is by far the best themes I have found on play store. There is a problem I found. The auto check box of brightness is invisible if it is unchecked. And I think icons in notification panel should be a little smaller. And in settings icons should be dark gray rather than black,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,Fantastic! My favourite theme! Started using it on my P9 lite and continued on my honor 8 lite! Can't imagine using EMUI without it anymore.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,EMUI 5.1 support?,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Vincent Van Schependom,Super,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Rajib Bhattacharjee,"Fantastic theme. The best implementation of aosp and oreo theme in the play store. Tried many of them but none comes close to this. One small request, can you make one pure aosp with blue color  instead of teal (with pixel style navbar), I think that will look classy :) Thanks again for the wonderful theme.",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Robert Goss,"I really enjoy this app only thing is battery icon in statues bar but that's honestly a nit pick that if fixed would be awesome but if not no big deal, after rebooting it's all fixedüòä",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Prathmesh Kherade,I used many Huawei themes.. But this is best.. And the way it replicates the Pixel navigation bar is fantastic,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Christopher Ghorayeb,Thank you for such a wonderful theme. A small suggestion if I may; I think the icons in the oreo settings menu need to be dark to mid grey rather than black.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Martin Pieterse,Love the smaller icons.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Daniele Migliari,There are 2 battery apps overlapped.,5

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,noner,"Would definately reccomend with EMUI 5, just as good as huawei themes",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,tiddly winks,"Literally, just one thing away from perfect. The all-white Oreo theme still has a dark volume slider!! If this gets fixed, I'd definitely consider donating!!",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Tim _bsb,Would be awesome if the brightness regulator would be like stock android. The pixel navbar is now near to perfect!!!!!! GREAT WORK,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Lapenski NYC,"The only thing that bothers me about this app is the battery icon, it's in portrait mode when it should be in landscape mode please fix. Thanks",4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,Nice,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Najeed I,Cool app just make sure you reboot and clear cache after installing.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,vlad s,THE BEST.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Tung DK,Best theme for Huawei Emui 5. Thank you,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Tom Zheng,Hey! I just want to say that the navbar icons should be larger and the gap between the icons should be wider!!!! I hope you can improve this points!!!!,5

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Spencer Park,"No noticable issues. Just a suggestion. When fast charging, I think the lightning bolt icons should be vertical to match the orientation of the normal charging icon.",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,David Garc√≠a,The lockscreen changes the background every time I restart my phone,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,christoffer n√§sberg,Thanks for this app.  Just what I needed.,5

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Kofi Skingley,"Seriously messes up my Huawei P9, icons have become letters, I uninstalled, deleted the themes, changed them and restarted the phone and they are still there. Awful.",1

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Hannes Huhtiniemi,It was great until there came a ad on the lock screen. Not cool man,1
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Max Lazar,"Great so far, just wished that for EMUI 5.1 on an Honor 9 the ""App Twin"" Icon in the Settings Menu would be themed  EDIT: Developer responded, just needed to restart. 5 stars now",5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Hardik Parmar,Awesome theme it is. The best theme i found for my honor 6x. Thanks for making such an amazing app,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Raif Ooi,Okay overall. Just have an issue with battery status display. The battery outline is displayed horizontally but the amount of battery is presented vertically. This is not an issue when the phone is charging though.,4
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,A Google user,Notification color issue fixed - topp! Banners on lockscreen are stock theme rounded... Keep up the good work!,4

h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Aleksandar Simovic,Fantastic work mate.,5
h7.hamzio7.aosp.ps,Muhammad Adam Zaidan,"its a really good icon pack for emui 5.0, but on my p9 plus the icons are waayyy to small for my screen so it just looks uncomfortable to look at. can yu fix it in the next update?",4
