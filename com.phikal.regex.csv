net.takoli.regexgen,Kees de Koster,"Nice, simple, useful!",5
net.takoli.regexgen,bill gannon,"I was looking for a simple, intuitive regex generator / checker and this app fits the bill perfectly. MUCH easier to simply select the mode (starting, containing, ending) and then bang in the specific values you are hunting for, and voila! Am instant magical regex appears. Genius.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,Kneel B,"Excellent app! Already know regex, but this will help spot any mistakes... Combine this with a sed command generator would save a lot of time...",5
net.takoli.regexgen,George Tzikas,Very basic. Flags don't work. No dark theme.,3
net.takoli.regexgen,Mukesh Singh,"Best app, thanks",5

net.takoli.regexgen,Jonas N,five stars if missing funktion flags is implemented. :),4
net.takoli.regexgen,Matt H,"I know regex already but had to give review seeing this because it's a clever, simple way of teaching it. Wish I had a similar tool when I was learning.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,spyman prog,very very good app thx,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Nghia Trinh,good app. thank you!,5

net.takoli.regexgen,Fernando Amaya,"Phenomenal app!! I spent hours looking for this info online with no avail and here you put it together all in a slick looking, interactive application XD thank you thank you thank you!!",5
net.takoli.regexgen,drizzt,"it was great, awesome. now has new feature / permission for network - which for me drops it by 2 stars.  sorry, but that's my personal feel.  others may not mind it, so would be good to them still. Update: fine now, so updating rating too.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,andrew Martens,Has landscape mode now :),4
net.takoli.regexgen,Sam Arv,App is good but how to generate regex to find an empty lines in text file,4
net.takoli.regexgen,L P,Updated version is very good,4
net.takoli.regexgen,Mf Malone,This App produces “made to order” RegEx search string. It does that pretty well!,4
net.takoli.regexgen,Myron Szymanskyj,"Android 6 allows the app to be moved to the inserted SD card.  Could an app update be released that allows your app to be moved to ""external storage"" as Android 6 describes it?  (Email address on app page is not working.)",4
net.takoli.regexgen,Michael Evans,I think I'll update my rating and give it four stars. The reason why it wouldn't work is because I forgot to escape my slashes. \b = \\b,4
net.takoli.regexgen,No. 6,Here's to having no permissions required!,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Eeli Haapalainen,"I'm a Java developer, I hate regex, but with this I can use regex well. Thanks! Awesome app!",5
net.takoli.regexgen,Ateeq Mujahidy,Really good,5
net.takoli.regexgen,A Google user,Usefull,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Ahmad Ruswandi,Great tool!,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Vinay,No way to test the expression.,2
net.takoli.regexgen,Tolik Varlamov,"I thought it would be a reminder for generating my own regexes, somewhat like a regex dictionary, like my own regex tester. But it does I don't even know what.",2
net.takoli.regexgen,A Google user,Very useful,5
net.takoli.regexgen,A Google user,Keyboard doesn't drop out of the way so can't see answer. Useless. Sam gal s6.,1
net.takoli.regexgen,Adarsha H D,Love it!,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Robert Shiplett,Cannot clear; must select to share,1
net.takoli.regexgen,Ashutosh Mishra,Okayish,2
net.takoli.regexgen,Robert Goley,Installed this expecting something similar to the txt2regex Linux utility. This app is extremely limited in comparison. It does not allow more complex expressions or regex language variants.,2
net.takoli.regexgen,Stefano Gualandi,"Nice and simple app but when used with the Google keyboard, at the end the keyboard does not disappear and it is not possible to read the final regex. If you solve this problem, I will rate the app with 5 stars.",3
net.takoli.regexgen,Dale Ferrier,This is not an iphone app we should not be locked into only portrait orientation.,4
net.takoli.regexgen,DG TALE,Excellent,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Igor Varfolomeev,"Eorks, but quite limited.",4
net.takoli.regexgen,Waqqar Azeem,I am always bad with Reg Expressions but this solved a problem.,5

net.takoli.regexgen,Rudy Kohn,Really easy to use.,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Abarajithan,Kinda useful!,4
net.takoli.regexgen,arun prasad,Useful,5
net.takoli.regexgen,mamba black,Excellent idea. :),5
net.takoli.regexgen,Alex Plumbley-Jones,Thank you for the share button!,4
net.takoli.regexgen,Eden Biskin,"This app is a great tool for those new to the vast world of regular expressions, offering a simple interface that guides one through the construction of a simple regex with or without alternation. It even comes packaged with a small cheat sheet that covers basic wildcards and some other common syntax, which is a useful tool even for experienced ""regexers."" Don't expect this app to help you build expressions for anything more than basic matches, though.",4
net.takoli.regexgen,Michael Duddles,Great functionality and UI,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Aadesh Srivastava,Awesome,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Nod Swal,I expected more. There are options set all the time between sections .* and /b,3
net.takoli.regexgen,Kishan K,Good one but only very 3 cases handled,3
net.takoli.regexgen,curusarn,for dev: I can send pics if you want to see them. I love the cheat sheet!,4
net.takoli.regexgen,Nicky Doyle,I'm using tasker and autovoice which uses PCRE. Support for that would be the best. Paste to CLIPBOARD button ;),3
net.takoli.regexgen,Abhinav Gupta,Hats off to developer who develops it. Thanks for making such a great app.,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Ben Veal,Useful,4
net.takoli.regexgen,Tim Loftus,"This is great for learning to use regular expression. Just type stuff in, see what happens, and look at the cheat sheet for clarification.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,Ryan Cobden,It looks great and works well. I was happy to see a cheat sheet. I wish it had templates for email and web addresses.,5
net.takoli.regexgen,A Google user,"""Say no to learning the syntax' LOL. But this is a very good way to learn it.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,Sean,Works great,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Zsemberovszky Zsuzsanna,Great app!,5
net.takoli.regexgen,Alan Truly,"Works great now. It's a big timesaver and would be a great learning tool also. The developer is very responsive, made a quick fix for a minor problem.",5
net.takoli.regexgen,Alpha Bah,Simple and elegant way of learning regex !!!!,5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Zucriy Amsuna,"It was fun while it lasted. I enjoy regex puzzles, and these satisfied that craving, but there are only a few levels.",5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Erik Johnson,It's fun but there are only 19 puzzles and half are the tutorial,4
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,64_Tesseract,"Awesome idea... but there only are 10 levels, so...",3
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,kebakent,"Quite fun, but a little too easy. I could have used a description at the beginning, explaining that the regex was of python variation and applied to the entire row/col.",5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,C,"Thanks for this, very nice app for practising.",5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Woebbi Woebbi,"Fun little game, wish there were more levels",5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Elena M,"I am sure it is a great app, but a tutorial that does not explain how the game works and what I should try to achieve is not really a tutorial, nor it tells me why my answer is wrong. It also assumes that I know the regex rules: actually, I wanted to learn them in more fun way. Pity.",1
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Pavitra Golchha,Nice to see a regex game!,5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Alex Forkosh,Great game. Please make more levels!!!,5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,R Google,"I like the game, but I really don't like that I can't see all of the regex patterns at once.",3
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,Jon Jablon,"Good app for what it is, but there are only six puzzles, and five of them are 2x2. This app is useful for approximately ten minutes. Make more puzzles please!",3
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,The Fox,"Paid the whole price of 40€ back in the day, worth every penny. Good thing it's for free now, though. Gonna download it for my five kids to learn some valuable life lessons.",5
de.chagemann.regexcrossword,A Google user,"Love the idea, but it does not work at all. Not the idea, the program itself. I could not enter any more than a single character into any of the textareas. Please fix. I will give it more stars once its playable.",2
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,Muhammad Sabir,Thank you its helpul .,5
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,Marco Ratto,Not works with big files,1
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,Mike Rodarte,"It shows if there is a match or not, but it doesn't show matched groups.",3
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,Nice little app. I would keep and probably frequently use if it had a few more features and help functions our maybe even snipers.,4
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,Nice and handy little tool!,5
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,"Great app, would be perfect if it included a small regex reference guide and some common examples, like for email address, URL, etc.",4
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,nice but need snippets and better GUI,5
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,good work! would also love prev/next buttons or some kind of history.,5
ch.dissem.android.regexmatcher,A Google user,nice! Please add next/back buttons to cycle through each match (or highlight all matches at once?),4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Charles Cares,It hasn't been updated since 2014. To be honest it remains a really good tool.,4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Rajay Thompson,One of the best regex tools for android I'd suggest this to anyone,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Ralph Bigio,"Horrible layout, no way to access clipboard, ANA you want me to pay for what I can't use? Last updated 2014, 4 years ago!",1
com.sevenbit.regexenator,A Google user,"Thank you, great app. Could do with a UI update.",5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Jacob Parker,A good regex tester and dev tool. Intuitive useful features. Only improvements that could be made are as-you-type regex matching and colored selected groups. Best working all around playstorr regex tester I could find. Was worth the pro upgrade just to help show appreciation to the developer for quality work.,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Tolik Varlamov,Excellent app! Very very convenient to use! Especially when it comes to typing characters like ^{}\|$[ and ] with a mobile keyboard.,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Gagandeep Saini,Good,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Chris Pierce,"I'm using this app as part of a coding process for a translator I'm making, but I really don't know anything about coding or how to use it. My question is if it's highlighted, does that mean it's matched? It would be nice to know I'm using it right before I try to enter it in without any result",4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Anand Betanabhotla,Looking forward to seeing more interesting additions to cookbook.,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,curusarn,"sweet app, configurable buttons are the best",5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Robert Ryan,"Easy to use and feature packed, this is my go to resource. The only thing it lacks is the ability to display captured groups in different colors.",5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Brian Lalonde,"Full regex power! It would be nice to save named regexes as Send targets, that would then offer a new Send destination after replacing using the regex.",4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Troy Dalton,"Seems quite capable so far, but I want to test a few of the claims made in some of the bad reviews.  If everything checks out, I will commit (support the developer).  UPDATE: Purchased.  I've had no trouble whatsoever and the developer is vested and happy to help.  I highly recommend Regexenator.",5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Louis Maddox,"Matches regex, but without highlighting capture groups any differently",3
com.sevenbit.regexenator,A Google user,I am ready to learn.,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,A Google user,best-featured & stable regex tool,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,V S,Fantastic but it doesn't recognise carriage returns via the $ character meaning I can't copy/paste multiline test data. Still the best available on Android though.,4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,David D,"This is the only app i've found which will allow backreference to search expressions from the replace expression. My only problem with the app is that it will not insert \n chars for some strange reason. Instead of new lines, it simply inserts ""n"". It also won't recognize ^ and $ as line begin and end.",4
com.sevenbit.regexenator,A Google user,Fantastic,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,M K,"Exactly what I was expecting, but better!",5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Valerie Burch,Awesome!   Best one available!,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Ankur Baranwal,It is one thing to struggle to make an app that tries to do something well. It's a totally different thing if you set out to make an app that does something you know little about in the first place. At least 3 of the 6 or so free examples in the cookbook are just wrong. To then expect payment for showing the rest is inexcusable.,1
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Mike Hickman,I've tried them all. This one is the best.,5
com.sevenbit.regexenator,Seth Mielke,Easy to use. Convenient to save my regex for later.,5
sky.programs.regexh,Wadee Noor,Nice,5
sky.programs.regexh,Bob N.,"I do not know why the people who are given this app such a high rating. First off, you cannot open files. Secondly, the text window is way too small. Thirdly, multiline is backwards. "".*the"" shouldn't select the entire text when multiline is disabled. When disabled, it should stop at the first ""the"" it finds.
