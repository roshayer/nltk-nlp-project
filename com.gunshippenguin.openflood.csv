com.gunshippenguin.openflood,Ian Abbott,"This is a nice little puzzle game which is basically the same as Flood-It! but with no annoying ads. The main thing that's missing is an auto-save and restore feature. Currently, exiting the app quits the puzzle you are working on.  Since the initial squares are filled in at random, I'm not sure what percentage of puzzles are technically solvable in the allotted number of moves even if you play perfectly. Perhaps it's more like solitaire games such as Klondike, where losing a lot of the time is expected. Or maybe I'm just thick.",4

com.labpixies.flood,Matt Fowler,"This game is about as close to a 2.5 star as you can get. The novelty and the mechanics of it are very fun and enjoyable, but the microtransactions aspect of the game will oftentimes leave you very frustrated. it's clearly obvious that they have baked in the notion that you have to buy extra steps to get to the very late game maps and the extra steps cost anywhere from $1 to $10 and at that point you should just uninstall the game and consider it done.",3

com.labpixies.flood,angela,I love it!,5
com.labpixies.flood,Eggplant Sam,I love this game but I wish there was another mode where you can see how many turns it takes to flood the board and try to beat your high score and your friends if you connect it to social media.,4

com.labpixies.flood,Roger Martin,I bitterly resent the trashing of my data plan in order to play uninterruptible video ads for Amazon (or anything else).  A pox on whichever dolt arranged that idiocy.,1
com.labpixies.flood,Carsten Orthbandt,The amount of ads in this game completely ruin it,1
com.labpixies.flood,Mark 1.0,I remember this game back in 2010 when smart phones were only out for 2 and a bit years. Great classic that has been a great time killer.,5

com.labpixies.flood,Christine Sommerville,"Was good, now ruined by the ads",1
com.labpixies.flood,Zach Franklin,"Fun game but awful, disruptive advertising and no option to pay to make it go away. Note to developers: having video ads with audio pop up randomly on people's phones is not OK.",2
com.labpixies.flood,Ryan McGarry,"The game board is random. In many circumstances the game is impossible to win in the number of moves given to you. So it would be nice if it allowed you to finish the game anyway and then let you improve on your score, and not just stop after X moves.",2
com.labpixies.flood,Zeeshan Muhammad,Excellent...,5
com.labpixies.flood,wolf packers,I win sometime sometimes i dont but its still very fun and challenging,5

com.labpixies.flood,Rebekah Ellis,It challenges your brain to think about patterns,5
com.labpixies.flood,A Google user,"Ads are very intrusive. This game has survived 3 phone changes, but it's uninstalled until the obnoxious ads that you are basically guaranteed to click on are removed.",1
com.labpixies.flood,A Google user,Been playing this game for years disappointed with the intrusive ads! Also in serious need of some hi-rez graphics,3

com.labpixies.flood,Beth,I didn't have a problem with ads but it was too hard and got boring there should be levels apart from that ok,2
com.labpixies.flood,Heidi Kohne,"Like others have said recently, this is such an addicting game to play, and I loved the fact that it wasn't a timed game.  Ever since the full-screen ads started that precede the game (tonight's was my first to also have sound) it is no longer fun to play.  I could live with the ones at the top of the screen while I'm playing.  Uninstalling.  Was a great run.",2
com.labpixies.flood,Corey Scott,"The ads are obtrusive and the permissions are unnecessary and not explained. Another good app ruined by bad updates. Switching to ""Color Flood"" by WetPalm instead.",2

com.labpixies.flood,Melinda Austin,This is a great game. Very entertaining.,5
com.labpixies.flood,Katie Burns,I downloaded this game and then I downloaded the anti virus app and it showed me it was a virus uninstall this app,1
com.labpixies.flood,Gregory Frech,This game was perfect before the latest update that added ads before playing. Had a great thing and ruined it. The adds in the banners is okay. I get it...you need money to run the app. I do not begrudge that. But a full screen add that you must exit out of before playing. Just horrible. I may uninstall as a result.,1

com.labpixies.flood,Sierra Riley,Ok. It wasn't the best game I've  played but it was alright. Kinda hard to figure out which color to do. There's a lot of pixels and only so many colors and moves. Wouldn't recommend it.,2

com.labpixies.flood,Will Makin,"This is a smart little game. Very basic idea (aren't they the best?) but it can be quite difficult to complete. I downloaded it onto my Nexus 7, and on that size screen it is great, but on a smaller one (like a mobile) I think that it would be too fiddly.  A great play and one to keep for a while.",5
com.labpixies.flood,Evelyn Terrell,HP touch pad(jelly bean) save will not display so that the small board will take.  And neither will color balls to pick! Please make where save panel shows on the screen. Please help me upgrade to more stars.  I keep reloading every couple of months to see if you upgraded.

com.labpixies.flood,Trevor McIntyre,It's an interesting and fun game to play for how simple the objective is. The only problem I have is with the buttons when it loads initially; sometimes they don't completely load and won't unless I tap the row that holds them. At which point I've played a color I didn't mean to play just to move on. Its a little annoying.,3

It would also make the game more fun if there where power-ups for turning 5 or more square at a time to increase your score and other power-ups like color scramble or something like that can be unlocked by turning a square with the symbol for that power-up.

com.wetpalm.colorflood,Greg Fotiades,"App works good and I support in-app ads to support the developers, but what I HATE is between rounds it blasts an ad with loud volume and no way to silence this ahead of time, making this game unplayable MANY places.  3/5 until there's a way to mute ads.",3
com.wetpalm.colorflood,Anon Omys,I was very happy to see that I could change the level to casual so I wasn't constantly losing. A mind challenging yet relaxing game. Thank you for developing this game!,5

com.wetpalm.colorflood,Jennifer Cravens,Ad in game as a bar then a pop up after every game... Annoying..  Remove pop up or allow us to buy ad free and I'll rate higher,2
com.wetpalm.colorflood,robert slattery,"That this is free with ads is fine, but the running banner ads at the bottom of every game coupled with the full screen ads between each new board is too much. Functional, so I would not call this a one-star game, but there are many of these and surely one exists that doesn't double-down on the adverts. With that in mind, there's no worthwhile reason to play this particular version of this game, unless, say, you know the developers.",2

com.wetpalm.colorflood,Elizabeth Apple,Finishing in 22 moves is based more on the random pattern than any level of skill,3

com.wetpalm.colorflood,Remigiusz Durka,Good game,4
com.wetpalm.colorflood,Christina Cleveland,"It's nice. The colors are nice. The flood (vs. Computer) mode is more challenging, but in general I don't feel motivated to keep playing. Once you beat all the modes and all the board sizes multiple times the game is just kind of done. Ads are annoying. Generally, I like to just pay a fee for no ads but I imagine that is less profitable than just forcing everyone to go through the ads. I do keep playing, I do look at my stats, but I don't know why. I guess because it's there and my life is sad enough.",3
