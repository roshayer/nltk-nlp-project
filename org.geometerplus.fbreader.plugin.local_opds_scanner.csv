org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Lester Wilson,It works,4
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,ABJ photography & video,Works great with FBreader premium on my Android 6 tablet. On my Android 10 phone I get a message that it was for an older version of Android. So its time for the developers to make an upgrade 😎😎,4

org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Julian Hughes,I just tried it on one device running Android 9 (Pie) and on a device running Android 8 (Oreo). It works fine on both. If you prefer to read on FBReader than this is the ideal way to connect with your Calibre content server.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Joe Bennett,Used to work great until Android 10 now won't connect to Calibre host. UPDATE: Just needed to update the Calibre host firewall settings. Works well again.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,debra ferrell,"When I tried to open it, I got a message that app was for an older version of FBReader, try updating. This is latest version, which was last updated 6/20/15. Uninstalling.",1

org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Stephen S,does not work,1
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,A Google user,This plug in works perfectly. It allows me to read any book from my PC's Calibre library on my phone using Fbreader. Metadata and covers are also transfered along with the book. I highly recommend app to anyone who uses Fbreader and Calibre.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,A Google user,خوبه,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Brion Lienhart,"This plugin works great when I'm at home and connected to my LAN. However, books that are downloaded to read away from home are lacking basics such as correct title and author. I can understand not copying the complete set of metadata from Calibre, but this is really lacking.  OK, they seem to have updated either this program or the main program. Now, MOST of my epubs and PDFs are copying over with correct author, title & various other info. There are still some that don't, and anything that I added to my tablet before the change are still lacking.",4
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Raul Ascencio,Works perfectly.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Tom Barringer,"Basically works well. I have been able to connect to Calibre, scan the library, and download and read books. However, when I download I get no metadata or cover image, and the book title is set to ""Calibre_Library"".",4

org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Kain Tesla,"After added Calibre server to library, when I visited it, said http/1.1 500 Internal server error. But I test the server on PC, it works fine. Update needed.",5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Elliot Jenner,"Does not work. Nothing I did would make my tablet and Calibre talk to each other or acknowledge each others' existence. Not even any incompatibility messages, just a continued instance that there is no catalog to connect to.",1
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Anne Kaelber,Highly configurable. My only complaint is navigating my library - tedious. I prefer to connect to my PC and transfer from Calibre.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Marc Gottlieb,Awesome combination,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Ronald Harvey,...search does not work well. I type in some words of a title and it does not find the books. Why?,3
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,clazh h,Helpful with calibre,4
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Erin McCarthy,I can't find my app to download more books. The store says it is already installed but is no longer on my phone. I uninstalled and then reinstalled; still not coming up my please fix this,3
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,A Google user,It works as expected.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,A. Arubeeka,It keeps asking for pluggings for everything...,1
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Ash Hughes,"Connects to Calibre and copies books across fine. However, metadata seems to be lost - author, title etc are all gone. Is this a bug or some extra setup step I need to do which could be made clearer?",3
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Laura Conrad,"I have a nit.  Actually, for my use case, it's a serious problem.  As advertised, it does seamlessly connect with the calibre server on my local network.  However, it (or maybe the install of FBReader Pro) removed the calibre server on a potentially external network, and I'm having trouble putting it back.  I don't think it should have taken away a feature I had working.    In other words, typing in the URL was a major pain, partly because it is not documented that the URL is different for FBReader than for a browser.  It is now easy, if it's a URL on the local network.  (You have to add /opds for FBReader).  Typing the URL for a non-local network is  still a major pain, if possible at all,  and this plugin or some other part of the FBReader infrastructure is making me do it again twice.",3
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,John Smith,"I love the FBReader app & plugins but I haven't actually been able to use all. I don't currently have Calibre installed & running on a desktop to use this but plan to. I have no djvu type books & have never seen any. Still, everything is great. IDK tho, I got the paid version & wonder if this, like other plugins, is now built in.",4
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Armando Recorriendo el Mundo,"After years of use my device as ebook reader,  fbreader is the first application I install when I upgrade my device ,  cell phone or tablet. This is the best ebook reader I tried",5

I've upgraded to Premium, and now I'm encountering features that I'm unsure whether I need them or not. I don't know what Calibre is, or DjVu. I just want to read books with no fuss, preferably offline. I could do that better with FBR free. Still love the main App, though.",2
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Kalebe Alves,Makes everything easier.,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Daniel Strom,But it's NOT the only OPDS server. Don't call it a Calibre plugin unless it's for adding wireless device sync or such.,4
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Arul Velan,"Installed Fbreader (ver 1.9.6.1) in ma nexus 5 Post which i downloaded couple of epubs from my gmail and the same got placed in the downlads folder of my nexus5 mobile. initally FBreader allowed me to add those epubs to the library and i started using it. was entharalled by the reading experience in FBreader, however it didn't last long. When i connected my nexus5 to cpu for charging some thing went wrong with the FBreader syncing and now my attempts to re-add the epubs to FBreader has failed gravely.

org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,A Google user,Just awesome,5
org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.local_opds_scanner,Rich Webmaster,"I have used this program on Windows 0$, All FBR downloads in the past are clean, I know the general rule by Geometer is all plugins or bonus add ons are different downloads & separate installs. Google play or Android market has everything however its not the best navigation system in the world. What slows the adding of plugins is all the icons are the same... knowing your not interested in 1 plugin with everything (and I agree, why install if never used), you make a numbered list. 0 is the FBReader main .exe .apk and 01 thru whatever have a static number that never changes & you make new icons that include said number (by script=easy). Also every new app added will update all your older app descriptions. This would make it faster for new installation and upgrades.... I have not run this android version yet, limited time right now, 5 star early! I miss the right mouse button on phones/tablets, copy, cut, paste... screen shots, full or sections, extract all images, text, urls, author info, etc... bookmarks, last viewed files, unlimited history... highlighting text with different colors, searchable by color & keyword.. sidenotes.

So I'm giving it only 4 stars. For now.  If you only use it on your own lan it's worth 5 stars hands down.",4
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,alan browne,Used it for years,5
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Bernd Phoenix,not working,1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,A Google user,It is possible to choose a download location in other 5.0 apps. Having downloaded books in /sdcard/android/data/ is just lazy.,1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,M W,"The last update broke down-loading. I'm using Calibre-Library on a tablet running Andriod 6.0.1. Before the November 2016 update, all was well. I could d/l to intermal folder or on SD.  Now, I have to jump through hoops---reenter the d/l folder name on the SD two or three times before I can D/L books from my connection server. The error message is that the folder is read-only. It is not.   After jumping through enough hoops, I can d/l books but this is getting REAL OLD! I'm downgrading Calibre-Library from 5-Stars to 3-Stars. I hope the developer gets this fixed.",3

The books exist in a non accessible virtual directory that you can't access. Broken. 1 star. Uninstalled and forgotten. Junk.",1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Aladdin Bushrui,Not sure what use this app has...doesn't open or associate with any eBook format...All it does is download useless manuals and titles.  Piece of crap.,1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Andrew Michael,This used to be a really good app but the recent updates for Android 5 have broken it as you can no longer specify the download folder and it puts the books in the wrong place for the Kindle reader.  A real shame!,1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Sandra Vale,"I can no longer specify the books directory either on Android 4.4 or 5. As   My Moon Reader points to my original directory with all my files in it, and I've loads of books downloaded onto a specified directory in main memory (not sd card), this app is now totally useless.",1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,John Davis,WAS a great app for calibre users. I can no longer specify the download directory. I used to use it to download .mobi files to my kindle app's directory. I can no longer do so.,1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Cary C,Don't be put off by the one-star ratings. They seem to all be by people who too lazy to read the app description and thus thought app would do things it was never meant to do. Sad that these people ding the app for their own laziness.  It does what it is designed to do perfectly well.,5
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Ana Coching,"I also downloaded other calibre stuff maybe they would work together but no. Setting up is confusing, so maybe you can assist me on this,  if not I would like to request for refund please.  Thanks!",1

com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,George Appleby,"Why pay for this app when, compared to all other apps, installation is so involved.",1
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Bill Stewart,"I gave the application one star because I could not get this application going. It may be that the problem is not with this app.  I couldn't get the network server in Calibre going. After following the trouble shooting procedures for a couple of hours, I gave up. There are too many points in the network between Calbre, Window Firewall, and the Android OS where the problem could occur and it's not worth it (to me) to spend hours to resolve the problem. I have a lot of technical expertise; so, someone who isn't technical will have little chance. The work around is to copy the eBooks from the Calibre library to the Android library via USB connection.",1

But I suspect I might be able to do some port forwarding",5
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Denise Kent,My go to app for transferring books. Took me a bit to set up. Now it's the #1 app I use most to transfer books from my calibre library on my PC to my nook color. So many different ways to sort and find the books I want to transfer. Well worth what I paid for it  1 1/2 years ago..,5
com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,Robert Kearns,I was not able to set up this app and after hours of trying and searching the net for fixes I stumbled across 'Calibre Companion' which fixed all my problems with the calibre program which would not recognising my Nexus 7.

com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,A Google user,"Being a book geek I love Calibre and used it extensively in conjunction with my Kobo Touch. Naturally when I finally purchased my first Android tablet (Nexus 7) exporting my eBook library to my device was one of the first tasks on my agenda.  After fiddling about with manually placing my books on the SD card and being left unsatisfied by the lack of customization options in the Akido reader I stumbled across this app. Being a self confessed 'noob' I was slightly lost at first as it wasn't immediately apparent what I had to do to sync the device with my library. Eventually, I found the 'connect/share' button on the desktop program and then clicked 'start wireless connection'. After this I was away, syncing my vast library with properly formatted author and book names complete with customized front covers.  Thanks to the team at Calibre for making eReading such a pleasurable and unique experience, and for placing the power back in the hands of the reader rather than the Amazon type corporations.",5

com.tonymaro.calibreLibrary.apk,A Google user,"Installed on my Nexus 7 and worked right off the bat.  Just turned on wireless in Calibre PC, put IP in via app settings, changed storage to my already existing ebook folder, and voila.  Had been using the web interface through Aldiko catalogs for couple years, but this has a nice interface and I wanted to support the development to hopefully get some features I would like to see in the future, e.g. setting rating in the app, flagging books already downloaded, showing more information like last read, not blinking out when wifi is off, etc.  I think it is still too early to give it 5 stars, but I can see the potential.",4

You still might want to give this app a try however.",1

com.multipie.calibreandroid,Mike Pearce,"The interface is so incredibly clunky. Dialog after never ending dialog and more sub-menus than you can imagine. When you connect to your Google Drive, navigation is super slow as it scans everything rather than let you just navigate to your library. Instead of a connect once thing like a normal app it's more like a switch, you are either connected or you're not. I have several Calibre catalog's and all I really want is the app to connect once to Google Drive, make note of which Calibre catalogs I have and then automatically sync their contents behind the scenes to my Android device with no further interactions. Then I want the app to show me my local on device catalogs up front, let me switch between these catalogs, browse the books,  mark books as read (and sync that status to Google Drive, and archive them from the main list) and open the book in my preferred reader. Instead this is the flow I have to use: whenever I add a new book to Calibre, have to go into CC reconnect to Google Drive, navigate to the catalog, click Titles so I view them all then sub-menu > Download All --   and then it tells me that 90% of my books don't have acceptable format/extensions.",1

Anticipating this I have tried many different Android app readers and after trying over a dozen of them concluded that none had any decent ability to handle large libraries and organize them effectively as the Sony reader did.  Then I encountered Calibre Companion!  All of my library of 1500+ works is on Calibre and I rely heavily on grouping by series and order of title in these series.  Location of a particular title is much simplified by this, and tthe Sony reader's 'collections' supported it.  Calibre Companion is the only app I have found allowing me this convenience on any reader of my choice.  Although Not as straightforward as the Sony reader, I can at last rapidly search and find desired works without long, tedious linear searches or title searches.

I bought it for my android but realized later that it is more useful for me on my iPad, but I don't want to pay twice for the same app. But I understand that developing for different platforms is different and that each platform has its own fees and things associated with it. I think this is just a general discontent I have with paid apps. This app was fairly easy to connect to my comp with WiFi and it transfered my books super quickly. I found a reader that accommodates multiple formats so that's good, but if we're paying for this app I do wish it had a reader in-built even if it means the size of the app increases. Anyhow, I still need to see whether or not it really does all I want it to. But so far it's a good app.",4

In the end I just bought a tablet that has dual boot (a cheap but very good Teclast Android/Windows10 dual boot retina tablet) and just installed Calibre on the Windows 10 part, then added the books via a 128GB SD card.

VERY FRUSTRATING! So far a wast of my money. By the way, I have read all the FAQ answers on the Calibre Companion site - which don't seem to address this basic issue.

It is, quite simply, the easiest and fastest way of transferring files and updating metadata. There are other ways of doing this, but having experimented with them, CC is by far to be preferred. As a library, it is quick and slick, and with the ability to assign specific book readers to specific file types, it is flexible as well. It would be nice to have a feature that permitted Calibre libraries to be read directly from a cloud drive, and frankly I like the library enough that I think a stand-alone version using only the local disk would be useful. In fact, before I found CC, I was looking around for a library program, because I was getting irritated by having a half-way decent library in a reader, but only a mediocre epub implementation. With CC both these problems are solved. I use Komik for cbr and cbz files, and Namo Pubtree for epub and both integrate well.",4

You don't need to be at your computer, just have it on and Caliber running with the content server on.

Now, if CC adds in the ability to browse my Calibre Library with Carousel viewing....I would give it a 5 without delay.   ORIGINAL POST ---> (I thought this app would help me get around the clunky Moon+ way of accessing Calibre by letting me utilize the Calibre server and virtual libraries.  Unfortunately, it appears that it can only access the virtual libraries in the wireless connection...not the content connections (the latter is where you actually transfer books from Calibre).

The main drawback to this approch has been my inability to browse or search my library as effectively as can be done with Kindle, Nook, or Calibre.  Not wanting to leave my desktop computer turned on 24/7, I store a portion of my library on Google Drive, an option which just does not provide the same level of library-management functionality as these alternatives.    Calibre Companion has been a tremondous improvement over my former system.  The ability to search my library on my Nook in very nearly the same way I do with Calibre on my iMac has provided a significant boost to my productivity.   I wish CC would allow me to edit tags and sync the changes with Calibre, but cannot find a way to do this.

com.multipie.calibreandroid,Pieter-Michiel Geuze,"I really enjoy the PC version for Calibre and I was really looking forward to using this on my new Nexus Tablet. It just doesn't work very well.  I have 2,000 books. I use the Calibre to transfer the books over to the Nexus into the Calibre_Companion folder. I turn on the Nexus and run Calibre_Companion and there are no books.  I run the Calibre_Companion and run the Connect and Download from Server and now I have three sets of the same book. I delete the Books with Missing Files and I have no copies again. I connect as Wireless Device and then I have two copies of each book.  Try to find the mobi files on the Nexus using Explorer and they are not there, run the EX Explorer on the Nexus and they are in an emulated folder but not that Calibre_Companion can see them.  Just stop.  Use the FB Reader. It uses the same ""Groups"" as C_C and can read the files where ever they are and runs the Reader directly. You can use the Calibre on the computer to update the metadata which will show up in FB Reader.  This program was a disappointment, either on its own or that it does not play well with the Nexus. Please let me know when it works better.",2

I have a Kindle fire that I hacked and put regular Android 4.03 on.  I can't stand the Kindle software, but the tablet itself is great.  So Calibre companion starts and I select the book I want and it starts Adilko for me.  It can sort on almost everything that you have in the full Calibre on your desktop.

I frequently update my calibre library, often adding 2 or 3 books and/or PDF documents a day, and I'm tired of running for a USB cable each and every time I want to update the calibre library on my phone and tablet.

With over 2000 sideloaded ebooks and other digital content, this app has been a lifesaver in library management. Whatever information I put in Calibre for an ebook, shows up in my catalog. Organizing by genres, series, etc is a breeze. No wifi is needed to access the app once the catalog is created and placed on the device. I even keep a column in Calibre for where I bought the book and have the info transferred to the app so I know where I bought it if there's a problem. How well it works for you depends on you, if you take the time to organize your books in Calibre itself, they'll be organized on your device the same way. I have my books placed in folders on my device by author making them easier to find as well. Once opened, a book shows up in my current folder on my Nook HD+ with bookmarks in place so I can access it without the app. Awesome!",5

com.multipie.calibreandroid,Jeremy Hoag,"for getting books from Calibre onto an Android device. A wirelessly connected device lacks the configuration options of a wired connection, but Calibre won't needlessly scan gigs and gigs of data you don't want it to manage before letting you change any settings. Both Calibre and Calibre Companion are the best we've got for managing significant ebook collections between Windows and Android, but both are less than good.

I can now sit in my living room and sync up with the Calibre library on my computer two floors away.  Perhaps the best feature of CC is the customer support. I emailed them about a couple of things that confused me (my lack of understanding--not deficiencies in the product), and the replies were prompt, informative, and ultimately helpful.

I figured I'd give it a try and couldn't believe the capabilities of the program. Calibre Companion is the icing on the cake. I have it loaded on my Razr and Acer tablet.

com.multipie.calibreandroid,A Google user,I use FBReader to read my ebooks and have always been very disappointed with their library function. Calibre Companion is the perfect solution. Two things the developers could do to make it even better: 1) make the font size adjustable for the book descriptions and 2) offer a library view that shows only book covers (preferably with a choice of sizes) in a shelf view.,5

Calibre Companion makes juggling my large library between computer and devices simple and eliminates most, if not all, of my pet peeves. Many thanks to the developers for my now favourite app.  Highly recommended to anyone using Calibre.",5
com.multipie.calibreandroid,A Google user,"EDIT: Latest update seems to do what I'm after. Thanks!  I was hoping that it would populate the Devices view of Calibre with the books I already have on the phone, like it does if I connect the phone in UMS mode.   This isn't a Calibre Companion problem, but I had problems with Calibre showing the wireless device connection option in the Connect/share menu even after updating. After looking at Calibre's configuration directory, and moving customize.py I realised it didn't like me disabling plugins in the past. After moving the file so that Calibre would make a new customize.py, I put the old entries sans disabled_plugins into the new file and Calibre then worked fine.  Personally, I recommend this app for the fact that you can convert and send to the phone in one step from Calibre. With the OPDS server, I'd have to initiate conversion from Calibre, wait for it to finish and then browse the server from my phone afterwards.",5

CC has gotten better virtually every day I've had it and it's now an unbelievably useful single point of entry into my ebook library.  First, if you have many ebooks, go get calibre and install it on your PC/Mac/Linux system. It's the best way to manage your library. Second, get Calibre Companion. It extends calibre's capabilities to Android 2+ devices and works with the ereader software you already have.

com.multipie.calibreandroid,A Google user,I was having problems with this app initially because of the fact that the developer is charging for an unfinished product.

com.multipie.calibreandroid,A Google user,"I use Kindle for Android on my device for reading my books.  Previously I have simply copied the books I want to read from the folder on my PC to the kindle folder via MTP via USB.  Whilst a bit of a pain, it worked.  So when I heard of this app I was hopeful that I could get past this, to true integration with my Calibre library.  Initially I had some problems with changing the locations that files were stored on my device, and the FAQs on the subject. However, I am pleased to report these were resolved in the latest build.  I still have problems with the network connectivity, for some reason, and despite my best efforts, I am unable to get the auto-locate option to work, so I forced to manually set IP addresses and ports.  The final area that I see this product is lacking is a good integration with Kindle for Android.  I understand many users will use Moon+ or Aldiko readers, but neither of these can access Kindle downloads.  I use both a Kindle device and an Android Tab, so I prefer to remain with Kindle for Android, as it can read all my books both from the Amazon and Calibre. If this part could be resolved, in my opinion this would be a great app.",3

So purchased this app. I realise it's in Beta but until it irons out the following it's not worth £2. Firstly nothing happens. Cannot connect, cannot connect through ip address. Nothing. Secondly I was under the impression that you'd be able to browse Calibre from your phone and then choose what to download, like the Kindle cloud. I got this impression from the description put out by Calibre. This appears not to be the case. Finally, I looked in the formats supported by this and it currently only supports epub and pdf files. This is not useful. I use my kindle for my books but prefer my phone with a large colour touch screen for my comics in .cbr and .cbz format. This app does not support them. Thus even if it were fixed for my handset, it would still be useless to me. Considering that Calibre supports such a wide selection of formats, you'd expect this app to do so also. There is no notification on the shop screen that only two formats are supported.  As such, for me, a complete waste of money until these issues are fixed. Uninstalling.",1

I have never found an app that has the perfect amount of customization to read comfortably from my phone without hurting my eyes or having to pinch and zoom disorientingly to be able to read the tiny words.

I mainly use ReadEra to read scientific articles where the downloaded name is typically cryptic. For example, 1804.00274.pdf. As far as I can tell, no Android reader has this function.
